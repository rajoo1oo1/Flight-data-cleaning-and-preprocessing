# Flight-data-cleaning-and-preprocessing

Project Overview

This project focuses on data cleaning and preprocessing . The goal is to solve the null value problem and remove the dublicates so that the dataset can be further use of machine learning algorithms. By accurately predicting flight times, flight platforms can enhance customer experience, optimize flight logistics, and improve overall operational efficiency.

Implementation Details

Methods Used
•	Data Cleaning

Steps Followed

1.	Data Collection: Gathered the flight dataset from the provided data source.
2.	Data Preprocessing: Performed data cleaning to handle missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies in the dataset. Conducted feature engineering to extract relevant features for the prediction model.
3.	Model Evaluation: Evaluated the performance of the models using appropriate metrics such as mean squared error (MSE),root mean squared error (RMSE) and R2 score.
